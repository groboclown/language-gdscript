# GDScript language support in Atom

Adds syntax highlighting and snippets to GDScript files in Atom.

Forked from the [Python language support for Atom](https://github.com/atom/language-python), because GDScript is based upon Python.  The original Python language support was originally [converted](http://atom.io/docs/latest/converting-a-text-mate-bundle) from the [Python TextMate bundle](https://github.com/textmate/python.tmbundle).

GDScript is the scripting language for the [Godot Engine](http://godotengine.org)

Contributions are greatly appreciated. Please fork this repository and open a pull request to add snippets, make grammar tweaks, etc.
